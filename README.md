# ðŸ§¶ Knot

Concise reactive state container library for Android applications.

# Concept

Knot helps managing application state by reacting on events and performing asynchronous actions in a structured way. There are five core concepts Knot defines: `State`, `Change`, `Action`, `Reducer` and `Effect`.

<img src="docs/diagrams/flowchart-knot.png" width="625" />

`State` represents an immutable state of an application. It can be a state of a screen or a state of an internal statefull headless component.

`Change` is an immutable data object with an optional payload intended for changing the `State`. A `Change` can be produced from an external source or be a result of execution of an `Action`.

`Action` is a synchronous or an asynchronous operation which, when completed, can â€“ but doesn't have to â€“ emit a new `Change`.

`Reducer` is a function that takes the previous `State` and a `Change` as arguments and returns the new `State` and an optional `Action` wrapped by the `Effect` class. `Reducer` in Knot is designed to stay side-effects free because each side-effect can be turned into an `Action` and returned from the reducer function together with a new state in a pure way.

`Effect` is a convenient wrapper class containing the new `State` and an optional `Action`. If `Action` is present, Knot will perform it and provide resulting `Change` (if any) back to the `Reducer`.

In addition to that each Knot can subscribe to `Events` coming from external sources and turn them into `Changes` for further processing.

# Getting Started

The example below declares a Knot capable of loading data, handling *Success* and *Failure* loading results and reloading data automatically when an external *"data changed"* signal gets received. It also logs all `State` mutations as well as all processed `Changes` and `Actions` in console.

```kotlin
sealed class State {
   object Initial : State()
   object Loading : State()
   data class Content(val data: String) : State()
   data class Failed(val error: Throwable) : State()
}

sealed class Change {
   object Load : Change() {
      data class Success(val data: String) : Change()
      data class Failure(val error: Throwable) : Change()
   }
}

sealed class Action {
   object Load : Action()
}

val knot = knot<State, Change, Action> {
    state { 
        initial = State.Initial 
    }
    changes {
        reduce { change ->
            when (change) {
                is Change.Load -> State.Loading + Action.Load
                is Change.Load.Success -> State.Content(data).only
                is Change.Load.Failure -> State.Failed(error).only
            }
        }
    }
    actions {
        perform<Action.Load> {
            switchMapSingle<String> { 
                loadData()
                    .map<Change> { Change.Load.Success(it) }
                    .onErrorReturn { Change.Load.Failure(it) }
            }
        }
    }
    events {
        source {
            dataChangeObserver.signal.map { Change.Load }
        }
    }
}

val states = knot.state.test()
knot.change.accept(Change.Load)

states.assertValues(
    State.Initial,
    State.Loading,
    State.Content("data")
)
```

Notice how inside the `reduce` function a new `State` can be combined with an `Action` using `+` operator. If only the `State` value should be returned from the reducer, the `.only` suffix is added to the `State`.

# Composition

If your knot becomes complex and you want to improve its readability and maintainability, you may consider to write a composite knot. You start composition by grouping related functionality into, in a certain sense, indecomposable pieces called `Delegates`. 

<img src="docs/diagrams/flowchart-composite-knot.png" width="625" />

Each `Delegate` is isolated from the other `Delegates`. It defines its own set of `Changes`, `Actions` and `Reducers`. It's only the `State`, what is shared between the `Delegates`. In that respect each `Delegate` can be seen as a separate `Knot` working on a shared `State`. Once all `Delegates` are defined, they can be composed together and provided to `CompositeKnot` which implements standard `Knot` interface. For more information check out [Composite ViewModel](https://www.halfbit.de/posts/composite-viewmodel/) post.

# Why Knot?

* Predictable - state is the single source of truth.
* Side-effect free reducer - by design.
* Scalable - single knots can be combined together to build more complex application logic.
* Composable - complex knots can be composed out of delegates grouped by related functionality.
* Structured - easy to read and write DSL for writing better structured and less buggy code.
* Concise - it has minimalistic API and compact implementation.
* Testable - reducers and transformers are easy to test.
* Production ready - Knot is used in production.
* Why not?
